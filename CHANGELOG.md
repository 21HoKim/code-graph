# Changelog

## 0.2.0

**Compile check — only what is broken turns red**
- Verify with the real toolchain: `gcc`/`clang -fsyntax-only` per translation unit (`compile_commands.json`
  aware), Python `compile()` + pyflakes undefined names. On open and on save (affected units only), or manually.
- Static problems without a compiler: parse errors, declared-but-undefined functions, called
  `NotImplementedError` stubs, undefined Python names, missing relative imports and local includes.
- Impact overlay: broken blocks red, dependent callers orange with distance, blocks only reachable through a break
  grey; cut wires with a break mark where the current sparks out. Problems panel with impact paths.
- Optional language-server errors; disabled in untrusted workspaces. CLI `--verify` (exit code 2 on errors).

**Run & Trace — threads, data and crashes**
- Python tracer (`sys.monitoring` / `sys.setprofile`) and C/C++ source instrumentation with a small runtime:
  per-thread calls, argument (and Python return) values, object identities, uncaught exceptions, crash stacks.
- Builds the translation units `main` needs; build, link and runtime failures show up red.
- Replay: thread swimlanes with play / scrub / step, glowing call stacks, thread-coloured pulses, values riding
  into blocks, unexecuted code faded, runtime-only wires, solo a thread, run summary with the thread tree and
  objects shared between threads, data trail for any object.
- CLI `trace` writes a replayable trace; `Load Trace File…` opens it.

**Other**
- Abstraction levels follow the language: Namespace only with C++, File → Function for C, Package → Module →
  Class → Function for Python.
- Broken C++/Python samples; the C++ router sample sends real payloads and loopback traffic.

## 0.1.0

- First release: static circuit view for C, C++ and Python.
- Five abstraction levels, files/symbols grouping, circuit/network layouts.
- Electric flow animation (arguments forward, return values backward).
- Static thread-spawn detection (std::thread, std::async, pthread_create, threading, executors, asyncio).
- Confidence levels for every link; search, focus, follow-cursor, incremental re-analysis, CLI.
